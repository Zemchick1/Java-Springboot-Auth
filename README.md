Spring Boot Auth

Custom Secure Authentication and Authorization Project based on Spring Boot

Overview

Spring Boot Auth is a comprehensive authentication and authorization framework designed to simplify the implementation of robust security features in Spring Boot applications. With built-in support for various authentication mechanisms such as OAuth2, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and basic authentication, this project provides developers with a solid foundation to secure their applications effectively.

Key Features

OAuth2 Integration: Seamlessly integrate OAuth2 authentication into your Spring Boot applications, enabling secure access to resources through popular identity providers like Google, Facebook, and GitHub.
JWT Support: Implement JSON Web Tokens for stateless authentication using Cookies, ensuring scalability and performance while maintaining security standards.
Basic Authentication: Easily configure basic authentication for simple use cases or legacy systems, providing a straightforward mechanism for user authentication.
Secure Password Storage: Employ best practices for password storage and encryption, ensuring the confidentiality of user credentials.

Spring Boot Auth empowers developers to focus on building core application logic while abstracting away the complexities of security implementation. Whether you're developing RESTful APIs, web applications, or microservices, Spring Boot Auth provides the necessary tools to establish a robust security posture and safeguard sensitive resources effectively.
